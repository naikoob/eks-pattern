This directory contains Terraform configuration to provision

* a VPC
* EKS cluster with:
** Control plane logging enabled
** IAM role for service accounts (IRSA) enabled
* Managed Node Group with:
** Cluster autoscaling (using IRSA)

NOTE: Cluster autoscaling and cloudwatch agents installation are implemented as templatized K8s yamls that should be applied with `kubectl` after cluster is provisioned. The generated yamls are found in the `outputs` directory after successful Terraform apply.
